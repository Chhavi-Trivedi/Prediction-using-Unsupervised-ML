**OBJECTIVE-Clustering of Iris Dataset**

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and
represent it visually.

**ALGORITHM USED - K-Means**

K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.

**Workflow behind Implemention of K-Means Clustering**
1. Choose the number of clusters k

2. Select k random points from the data as centroids

3. Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid

4. Recompute the centroids of newly formed clusters

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4
